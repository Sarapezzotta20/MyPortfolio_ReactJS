            I'm an aspiring Junior Software Developer with a deep passion for
            coding and a solid foundation in Full Stack Development. My journey
            into technology is fuelled by a fascination with innovation and a
            commitment to staying ahead in this ever-evolving field.
            <br />
            <br /> As a certified Full Stack Developer, I've honed my technical
            abilities through continuous learning and hands-on projects, always
            eager to tackle new challenges.
            <br />
            <br /> Before transitioning to software development, I worked as a
            Freelance Translator, ELICOS Teacher, and Bar Supervisor & Manager.
            These roles have sharpened my communication, collaboration, and
            leadership skills, making me adept at adapting to new challenges
            with creativity and resilience.
            <br />
            <br /> I thrive in dynamic environments where creativity and
            problem-solving intersect, and I am passionate about fostering
            connections and sharing knowledge. I believe collaboration is key to
            creating innovative solutions, and I am committed to making
            meaningful contributions to tech projects and teams.
